# Skillcraft Technology Internship Task
Welcome to my internship task repository! This repository contains the task assigned during my internship as a Software Development Intern at Skillcraft Technology. This task focuses on developing my skills in programming, problem-solving, and software development.

As a Software Development Intern at Skillcraft Technology, Iâ€™m working on real-world projects and building practical skills in software development. This repository contains the completed task, along with code documentation and explanations.

Task 2: Guessing the Random Number
----------------------------------
This repository contains a simple Python program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The game gives the user three attempts to guess correctly. If the user is unable to guess the number within those attempts, the program reveals the correct number.

How the Game Works
------------------
The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The user is prompted to guess the number.
After each guess, the program provides feedback:
If the guess is too low, the program displays "Too low! Try again."
If the guess is too high, the program displays "Too high! Try again."
If the guess is correct, the program congratulates the user and ends the game.
If the user fails to guess correctly within three attempts, the program reveals the correct number.

Features
--------
1. Random number generation for a unique number each game.
2. User-friendly prompts and feedback.
3. Error handling for non-integer inputs.
4. Automatic reveal of the correct number after three failed attempts.
